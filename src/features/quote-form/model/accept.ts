 * The funnel's commit point, independent of HTTP. Order is the invariant:
 * validate → screen → **insert** → (deferred) notify and capture.
 *
 * Nothing that passes validation is thrown away. A submission the barriers
 * suspect is stored with its `spamVerdict` and simply not notified: a
 * mis-set clock, a fast thumb or a shared carrier NAT must not cost a real
 * customer, and a reviewer can still find the row. A lead with no point, or
 * one we no longer have (an old page, a stale form), is stored without one.
 *
 * A notification failure logs and changes nothing; a store failure is
 * `failed`, never `stored` — a thank-you page for a lead that was never
 * written is the worst outcome this system can produce.
