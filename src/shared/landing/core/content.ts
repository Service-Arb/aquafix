/**
 * The copy contract the shared machinery reads. A brand's `Text` extends
 * `CoreText` and adds everything its own sections say; a shared widget takes
 * only its slice (`StatusCopy`, `QuoteFormCopy`, `PageMetaCopy`…), so a brand
 * can reword its hero without the status screen's type noticing, and a
 * widget's signature says which words it can print.
 *
 * `F` is the brand's facts — the phone, the place, the prices a sentence may
 * quote. Prose that quotes a fact takes it as an argument instead of spelling
 * it out, so the number in the sentence and the number on the card are one.
